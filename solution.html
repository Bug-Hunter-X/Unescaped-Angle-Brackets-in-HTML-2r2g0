<p>This example demonstrates how to correctly escape angle brackets (&lt; and &gt;) in HTML using HTML entities.  Using HTML entities ensures that the browser interprets these characters as literal text rather than HTML tags.</p><p>Here's the corrected code:</p><code>&lt;p&gt;This is my text &amp;lt;b&amp;gt;with some bold text&amp;lt;/b&amp;gt; in it.&lt;/p&gt;</code><p>In this corrected version, <code>&amp;lt;</code> represents the &lt; character, and <code>&amp;gt;</code> represents the &gt; character. This prevents the browser from misinterpreting these characters as HTML tags, ensuring that the text is rendered correctly.</p>
