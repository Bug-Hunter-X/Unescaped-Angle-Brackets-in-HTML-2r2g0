<p>This is a common error, but it can be hard to spot if you're not careful. The issue is that the <code>&lt;</code> and <code>&gt;</code> characters are not properly escaped in the HTML.  In HTML, these are used to denote the start and end of HTML tags.  If they appear in your text without escaping, the browser will try to interpret them as tags, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.</p><p>For example, consider this code:</p><code>&lt;p&gt;This is my text &lt;b&gt;with some bold text&lt;/b&gt; in it.&lt;/p&gt;</code><p>The browser will likely render this as just the text "This is my text" because it will interpret &lt;b&gt; and &lt;/b&gt; as the start and end of a bold tag. The closing tag will also be mis-interpreted. The correct way to render this is to use HTML entities.</p><p>The solution is to use HTML entities to represent these characters. The HTML entity for <code>&lt;</code> is <code>&amp;lt;</code>, and the HTML entity for <code>&gt;</code> is <code>&amp;gt;</code>. Replacing the characters in the sample code with the appropriate HTML entities will fix the problem.</p>
